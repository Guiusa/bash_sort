<h1> bash_sort </h1>
<h2> I recreated the 'sort' bash program in C as a test for Progaming II discipline. </h2>

</br>
<p> There are some files with text prompt in textFiles directory. The program can be texted by running "make" in the project directory and </br>
./mysort textFiles/a textFiles/b textFiles/c textFiles/d textFiles/e </br>
or, run "cd textFiles" and </br>
../mysort a b c d e
</p>
<p>This project has 2 branches, the main branch that will be used to add -r and -u options in the program and the test branch, that was my original 2-hour solution to the test proposal</p>
